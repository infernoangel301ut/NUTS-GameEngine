## What is NUTS?

Well, we're definetly not talking about actual **_nuts_**.

NUTS is a game engine that uses Python and Raylib (or at least a Python port of it).

Its way to be used is highly inspired by another game engine called HaxeFlixel, and also takes other elements from other game engines, such as Unity and Godot, while also adding its own elements.

Oh, also, it was made as a project for school, so unless it somehow becomes really used, I probably won't be updating it after its release.
