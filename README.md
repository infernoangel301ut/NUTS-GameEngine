# NUTS Game Engine

Si prefieres leer el documento en español, [Haga click aquí](/README_Ñ.md).

## What is NUTS?

Well, we're definetly not talking about actual **_nuts_**.

NUTS is a game engine that uses Python and Raylib (or at least a Python port of it).

Its way to be used is highly inspired by another game engine called HaxeFlixel, and also takes other elements from other game engines, such as Unity and Godot, while also adding its own elements.

Oh, also, it was made as a project for school, so unless it somehow becomes really used, I probably won't be updating it after its release.

## How do I install NUTS?

First of all, you will need the Python programming language, so if you don't have it yet, [click here](https://www.python.org/) to go to the official website.

Next, you will need the dependencies, which fortunately for you, you will only need the Python port for Raylib. So you can [click here](https://electronstudio.github.io/raylib-python-cffi/README.html#installation) to go to the documentation... or you can stay here and run the following commands to be a lot faster, your choice.

These are the two commands to run:

```bash
python -m pip install setuptools
python -m pip install raylib
```

And now that all the dependencies are installed, it is time to install NUTS!

Just download the file in the repository called [**nuts.py**](/nuts.py) and add it to your game folder. Yes, that's it.
