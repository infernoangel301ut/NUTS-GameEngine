Stuff to be done, just to remember.

Before public release:
- Get NUTS to, at the very least, a state which can actually be useful [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Test and fix any remaining bugs in NUTS. [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Remake the README file, both in English and Spanish. [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Remake the documentation, both in English and Spanish. [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Create tutorials, both in English and Spanish. [STATUS: DISCARDED]
- Create code examples to cover general features (tutorial replacement). [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Correct typos in the Spanish translations (even though Spanish is my native language lol). [STATUS: DONE, 100%]
- Create a Release on GitHub. [STATUS: DONE, 100%] [INFO: NUTS IS FUCKING OUT! LESS GOOOO]

After public release:
- Readd collision system (it was working extremely bad, and since it was something kinda secondary, I removed it temporarily).
- Fix bugs reported on Github or found by myself.
- Add more animation systems (like Aseprite).
- Finding other people to work on NUTS? (they'll have to work for free since I'm not making any money from this).
- Adding more utils to NutVector2 and NutColor.
- Getting a logo (please let it not be hairy testicles lmao).
- Making and adding a placeholder for when sprites are not found (kinda like how HaxeFlixel does it).
- Adding a 3D system because would be cool.
- Adding multiple windows support (this is going to get crazy).
- Adding UI objects (like buttons, text inputs, and stuff like that).
- Adding shader support.
- Other stuff that I might think of in the future (or suggestions from people).
