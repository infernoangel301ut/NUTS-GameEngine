Hey!! I see you're trying to install NUTS Game Engine.
You need to order some stuff so the setup file can do its work,
so here's a quick guide!
(This guide will assume you already have Python installed)

1. Install nuts-setup.py, nuts-manager.py, nuts.py and nuts-setup-config.json from your desired version
   (you can find those on https://github.com/infernoangel301ut/NUTS-GameEngine).
   1. 1. As a quick note, you can add a custom nuts.py file and add it as a new version
         by changing the version value on nuts-setup-config.json.
2. Run nuts-setup.py and let it do the rest.
